Project Description

Emergency room visits rose after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, with Medicaid and CHIP users accounting for the bulk of these visits. When Donald Trump entered the White House, he proposed budget cuts on Medicaid, CHIP and Medicare; programs that many rely on to mitigate the costs of their health-related needs. Our research project will analyze health-related conditions that land individuals in the emergency room or lead to hospitalization. We will also be looking into how Medicaid coverage plays into the usage of these healthcare resources as well as the amount of monetary support provided by Medicaid in these real-life cases.

In order to successfully analyze the usage of healthcare resources, we will be working with New York State's Medicaid Chronic Conditions, Inpatient Admissions and Emergency Room Visits by Zip Code: Beginning 2012 data. The data is provided by New York State Department of Health and can be accessed on the official New York State website. The dataset contains emergency room, inpatient admission, and medicaid data from 2012-2014.

In addition to the New York State Department of Health dataset, there has been a significant amount of literature and data analysis done in investigating and collecting medicaid and medicare data. Many of these articles can be found on ResDac's PubMed Articles using Medicare or Medicaid Data website. Below is a list of the most relevant articles which are similar to the study we are doing and which will aid us in our data exploration and analysis.

-The interaction between rural/urban status and dual use status among veterans with heart failure: This study investigated a similarly structured dataset to analyze whether there is a difference between the use of Medicaid in rural areas versus urban areas. The project concluded through the dataset of medicaid claims made, that "rurality significantly modifies the likelihood of Emergency Department visits for Heart Failure".  It also concluded that dual use appears to be a marker for higher healthcare utilization and worse outcomes for both urban and rural veterans.

-Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Readmissions in US Hospitals: The Role of Insurance Coverage: This study examined differences in rates of 30-day readmissions across patients by race/ethnicity and the extent to which these differences were moderated by insurance coverage. They found higher readmission risk for non-Hispanic blacks, compared with non-Hispanic whites, among those covered by Medicare and private insurance, but lower risk among uninsured and similar risk among Medicaid.

-Influenza Vaccination Coverage Estimates in the Fee-For Service Medicare Using Data Adaptive Techniques: This project explored the vaccination coverage estimates in the Medicare population through the use of administrative claims data.  Through their data exploration they were able to develop a tool to help shape outreach effort and inform strategies to help raise influenza vaccination rates. This tool was developed to help reduce the number of older adults who are unvaccinated for seasonal influenza.

-Association of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion With Access to and Quality of Care for Surgical Conditions: Lack of insurance coverage has been associated with delays in seeking care, more complicated diseases at the time of diagnosis, and decreased likelihood of receiving optimal surgical care. This study therefore "investigated the association of the ACA's Medicaid expansion with access to timely and recommended care for common and serious surgical conditions" so as to gauge the impact of the expansion.

-Deciphering Medicaid data: Issues and needs: While this study is not immediately similar to our project, it will aid us in our investigation. This study reviews the wide range of databases that can be used for Medicaid analyses and research and discusses the problems with each dataset. In addition to that, this paper will be beneficial in helping us the different methods and analysis we can perform on our dataset to gather meaningful statistics.

Our target audience will be those who are either for or against Medicare and other similar programs. Based on the findings from our dataset, we will be able to provide evidence for sides of the argument. Also, we hope to educate people on how Medicaid is spent. This will provide a perspective for the audience to decide their stance on healthcare. We hope to educate the audience on the impact of Medicaid, how it is used, and health conditions that land individuals in the emergency room.

Three potential questions that our audience should learn from our resource are:

-Does programs such as Medicaid, CHIP and Medicare increase emergency room visits?
-How does Medicaid help those who qualify?
-How would budget cuts impact healthcare for those who receive Medicaid currently?

Technical Description

Our final product will be presented in the form of an R Shiny application.

Our application is interactive data application that it will use data wrangling, data report, and data visualization. For the purpose of data wrangling, we will have to learn how to use dplyr, sqldf, and tidyr library of R. We will also learn hsmic for data analysis, knitr for data display, GoogleVis for data visualization, and ggmap for mapping. In addition to R libraries, we will learn libraries of JavaScript, such as plotly, D3.js, React.js, D3 maps, scrolling, and networks for data visualization.

Our application will contain analytical methods and machine learning to create logistic regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, and decision tree. In order to successfully implement the machine learning application, we would have to learn MICE library for missing value, rpart for data partition, caret for regression, and randomForest for decision tree in R.

There are definitely data collection and management problems we are expecting to face. For instance, there might be limited or excessive volume of data where we may face the challenge of aggregating, managing, and creating value from data. There may also be a problem when designing an appropriate tool to capture information.

Major challenges we anticipate to face when building our application are reactive approach and lack of skills. For example, we may take a reactive approach on data management that we may realize later that there was a problem with initial data. Moreover, we may also face time and quality control issue due to our lack of skills. Thus, professional technical skills on research, planning, and quality assurance will be required to overcome these major challenges.
